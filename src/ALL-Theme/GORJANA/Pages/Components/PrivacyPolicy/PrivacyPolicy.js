Once we receive your request, we will let you know what, if any, personal information we can delete from our records, and we will direct any service providers and contractors with whom we disclosed your personal information to also delete your personal information from their records.</p>
                <p>There may be circumstances where we cannot delete your personal information or direct service providers or contractors to delete your personal information from their records. Some of these instances include, but are not limited to, if we need to: (1) retain your personal information to complete a transaction or provide a good or service; (2) detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for that activity; (3) debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality; (4) exercise free speech or ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right to free speech; (5) comply with the law; and (6) use your personal information for internal and lawful purposes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete the transaction for which the PI was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated by you within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between the Company and you.</li>
                    <li>Help to ensure security and integrity to the extent the use of the consumer's PI is reasonably necessary and proportionate for those purposes.</li>
                    <li>Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
                    <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
                    <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code.</li>
                    <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research that confirms or adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the Company's deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the ability to complete such research, if you have provided informed consent.</li>
                    <li>To enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with the Company and compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.</li>
                    <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may submit a request to delete your personal information by calling us Monday-Friday from 6am–5pm PST, emailing us, or using our contact form. Once you contact us through one of these channels, we will need to verify the request to process it.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Right to Request Correction.</strong></p>
                <p>You have the right to request that the Company correct any inaccurate personal information we maintain about you, taking into account the nature of that information and purpose for processing it. Upon receipt of a verifiable consumer request (see below), and as required by the CCPA, we will provide a response to such requests.</p>
                <p>You have the right to direct that the Company limit the use of sensitive personal information we collect about you to (i) uses that an average consumer would expect are reasonably necessary to provide the goods and or services you have requested, (ii) perform certain other activities permitted under the CCPA, and (iii) what is permitted by applicable law. Your right to direct the Company under this paragraph applies only to sensitive personal information that we collect or processed for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you.</p>

                <p><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights</strong></p>
                <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA, as described above. This includes, but is not limited to: (A) denying good or services to you; (B) charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; (C) providing a different level or quality of goods or services; or (D) suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The consumer who is the subject of the request,</li>
                    <li>A consumer on behalf of the consumer’s minor child, or</li>
                    <li>By a natural person or person registered with the Secretary of State authorized to act on behalf of a consumer.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>What to submit.<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>If we request, you must provide us with sufficient information to verify your identity and/or authority to act on behalf of a consumer. In general, we may ask you to provide identifying information that we already maintain about you or we may use a third-party verification service. In either event, we will try to avoid asking you for sensitive PI to verify your identity. We may not be able to respond to your request or provide you with PI if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the PI relates to you.&nbsp; However, making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
                <p>Additionally, you will need to describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to review, understand, assess, and respond.&nbsp; We will not use the PI we collect from an individual to determine a verifiable request for any other purpose, except as required by law.</p>

                <p><strong>Our response.<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>We reserve the right to charge a fee to process or respond to your request if it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that a request warrants a fee, we will attempt to notify you as to why we made that decision and provide a cost estimate before completing your request. We will endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) calendar days of receipt, but we may require an extension of up to forty-five (45) additional calendar days to respond and we will notify you of the need for the extension.</p>
                <p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.&nbsp; If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.&nbsp; Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of your verifiable consumer request. With respect to personal information collected on and after January 1, 2022, and to the extent expressly permitted by applicable regulation, you may request that such disclosures cover a period beyond the 12 months referenced above, provided doing so would not require a disproportionate effort by us. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. To the extent permitted by the CCPA, we will respond to no more than two requests during any 12-month period.</p>

                <p><strong>Authorized Agent</strong></p>
                <p>You may authorize a natural person, or a business registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf with respect to the right under this CA Addendum. When you submit a Request to Know or a Request to Delete, unless you have provided the authorized agent with a qualifying power of attorney, you must provide your authorized agent written permission (signed by you) to act on your behalf and verify the authorized agent’s identity with us. We reserve the right to deny requests from persons or businesses claiming to be authorized agents that do not submit sufficient proof of their authorization.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
