                <p style={{fontSize : '13px' ,color : '#7d7f85'}}>Lab-grown diamonds have the same chemical, optical and physical properties as mined stones. The only difference lies in their origin. We cultivate our diamonds from labs with the help of technology and expert growers who value sustainability and quality. Our diamonds are placed in simulated environments that allow them to develop the same way as mined diamonds. Smiling Rocks believes in transparent manufacturing and responsible sourcing. Our in-house production makes our pricing affordable and our jewelry unique.</p>
